## BOM

Arduino Nano
EC11 rotary encoder (e.g. PEC11R-4215F-S0024)
SSD1306 display
MCP2515 CAN bus module (will be mounted flipped so boards with already soldered pins can be used)
2x 100nF 0805 for rotary debounce
2x 3,5mm screw terminal (optional, one can be salvaged from the CAN bus module)
Female headers 2.54mm (optional when the break out boards are soldered directly to the PCB)
