## BOM

- Arduino Nano
- EC11 rotary encoder (e.g. PEC11R-4215F-S0024)
- SSD1306 display
- MCP2515 CAN bus module (will be mounted flipped so boards with already soldered pins can be used)
- 2x 100nF 0805 for rotary debounce
- 2x 3,5mm screw terminal (optional, one can be salvaged from the CAN bus module)
- Female headers 2.54mm (optional when the break out boards are soldered directly to the PCB)
